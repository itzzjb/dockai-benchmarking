This is a Go REST API application using only the standard library.
The application exposes a REST API on port 8080.
No external dependencies or CGO required.

CRITICAL: Build the Go binary with CGO_ENABLED=0 for static linking.
This allows the binary to run on minimal images without GLIBC.

Use multi-stage build:
1. Build stage: Use 'golang:1.21-alpine' or 'golang:1.21'
2. Runtime stage: Use 'alpine:3.19' (NOT distroless, as it may have issues)

Build command MUST include:
- CGO_ENABLED=0 (disable CGO for static binary)
- GOOS=linux
- go build -ldflags="-s -w" for smaller binary

Example build command:
CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o /app/server .

DO NOT use distroless images - use alpine:3.19 instead for the runtime stage.
Alpine is small (~5MB) and includes basic utilities for debugging.

Expose port 8080.
Run as non-root user.

[instructions_reviewer]
Verify CGO_ENABLED=0 is set in the build command.
Ensure alpine (not distroless) is used for runtime.
Check that the binary is statically linked.
